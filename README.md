## Canadian Chamber of Commerce Learning Platform
Canadian Chamber of Commerce Learning Platform is an online learning and teaching platform meant to allow both students
and instructors to be in one simple to use and convenient platform for learning.

## Motivation
As students, we created this project simply because we needed something like it, a place where
quality learning can be found with the touch a button. Also as Computer Science students we needed 
to practice/learn web development, as it is the most popular form of Software development in recent years, so this project
was a great entry and got us familiar with the technologies used in that particular field.
It is also part of our curriculum CSEN 704.

## Build Status
The project is complete as of January 2023. Unit tests could be added for stress testing. For contributing, check out the contributions sections below.

## Code Style
The project was built with the standard react functional component coding style along with node and express. The client side was divided into page and component folders housing each react component along with the styling. The server side was divided into routes, controllers, and middlewares to serve all the client requests. Prettier was used for formatting all the files. Most of the code was written in camelCase except for react components which were declared using PascalCase.
